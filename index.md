# About Me


Here is **Xu Feng (冯旭)**.<br>

I am a Research Associate working with [Dr. Loretta Mickley](https://scholar.harvard.edu/mickley) and [Prof. Daniel Jacob](https://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/daniel-j-jacob) in the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group at Harvard University. My current research focuses on (1) using machine learning techniques to quantify wildfire plume injection heights and their effects on smoke exposure in Australia, (2) investigating the potential drivers of trends in wildfires and smoke exposure in the western United States over the past three decades, and (3) assessing the impacts of historical fire suppression in the western United States.<br>

I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Peking University under the supervision of [Prof. Tzung-May Fu](https://atmoschem.org.cn/index.php?title=Tzung-May_FU). My research interests include the development of regional air quality models and their applications, as well as the integration of machine learning techniques in air quality modeling. I worked on three main projects: (1) the online two-way coupling of the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model with the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem (WRF-GC), (2) assessing the impacts of ship emissions on regional air quality in Southern China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) applying machine learning techniques to predictions of open-burning of crop residues and its impacts on regional air quality in Southern China.<br>

I earned my B.A. in atmospheric science from Sun Yat-Sen University, with research experience in air pollution modeling and computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling. Outside of research, I enjoy drawing, attending musicals, and engaging in puzzles and Lego.<br>
